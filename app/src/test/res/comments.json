However, you’re responsible for your team and it’s an important leadership moment. Everyone will be looking to you. \n\nI would definitely have a meeting with everyone to discuss it at the very least. See if anyone had any experience with it, give them space to say what they saw, or how they feel. Safe space and so on. Brushing it under the rug just kills morale and makes people feel like it doesn’t matter — which makes you the same kind of leader as the ones that are in the news now. Be better.\n\nAnd if your boss has an issue with that, I’d leave. The only way the company can recover is to accept the mistakes and take action to fix it. If they won’t let people discuss it, then they’re not interested in change, and that WILL reflect on you when bad behavior continues to happen.",

However, you’re responsible for your team and it’s an important leadership moment. Everyone will be looking to you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would definitely have a meeting with everyone to discuss it at the very least. See if anyone had any experience with it, give them space to say what they saw, or how they feel. Safe space and so on. Brushing it under the rug just kills morale and makes people feel like it doesn’t matter — which makes you the same kind of leader as the ones that are in the news now. Be better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if your boss has an issue with that, I’d leave. The only way the company can recover is to accept the mistakes and take action to fix it. If they won’t let people discuss it, then they’re not interested in change, and that WILL reflect on you when bad behavior continues to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
